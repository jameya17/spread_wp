                                    <li>The version valid at the time the contract is concluded is decisive. Deviations from these and other supplementary agreements with the customer are only effective if they are confirmed in writing by the agency.</li>
                                    <li>Any terms and conditions of the customer will not be accepted, even if known, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing in individual cases.

                                <p>Before placing the order, the agency expressly points out to the customer that the providers of "social media channels" (e.g. facebook, hereinafter referred to as providers) reserve the right in their terms of use to reject or remove advertisements and appearances for any reason . The providers are therefore not obliged to forward content and information to the users. There is therefore a risk, which the agency cannot calculate, that advertisements and appearances will be removed for no reason. In the event of a complaint from another user, the providers grant the possibility of a counter-notification, but the content will also be removed immediately in this case. In this case, it may take some time to regain the original, legal status. The agency works on the basis of these terms of use of the providers, over which it has no influence, and also bases an order from the customer on them. By placing an order, the customer expressly acknowledges that these terms of use (co-)determine the rights and obligations of any contractual relationship. The agency intends to carry out the customer's order to the best of its knowledge and belief and to comply with the guidelines of "social media channels". However, due to the current terms of use and the simple possibility for every user to claim violations of the law and thus have the content removed, the agency cannot guarantee that the commissioned campaign can also be accessed at any time. over which it has no influence and also bases an order from the customer on this.

                                <strong>Protection of concepts and ideas</strong>
                                <p>If the potential customer has already invited the agency in advance to create a concept and the agency accepts this invitation before the conclusion of the main contract, the following regulation applies:
                                    <ol class="counter-inner">
                                        <li>The potential customer and the agency already enter into a contractual relationship ("pitching contract") with the invitation and the acceptance of the invitation by the agency. This contract is also based on the General Terms and Conditions.</li>
                                        <li>The potential customer acknowledges that the agency already provides cost-intensive advance services with the concept development, although he has not yet assumed any performance obligations.</li>
                                        <li>The concept is subject to the protection of copyright law in its linguistic and graphic parts, insofar as these reach work height. The potential customer is not permitted to use and edit these parts without the consent of the agency, if only because of the copyright law.</li>
                                        <li>The concept also contains advertising-relevant ideas that do not reach the level of a work and therefore do not enjoy the protection of copyright law. These ideas are at the beginning of every creative process and can be defined as the igniting spark of everything that is produced later and thus as the origin of marketing strategy. Therefore, those elements of the concept that are unique and give the marketing strategy its characteristic character are protected. Advertising keywords, advertising texts, graphics and illustrations, advertising material, etc. are regarded as ideas within the meaning of this agreement, even if they do not reach the level of a work.</li>
                                        <li>The potential customer undertakes to refrain from commercially exploiting or having exploited or using or having used these creative advertising ideas presented by the agency as part of the concept outside of the corrective of a main contract to be concluded later.</li>
                                        <li>If the potential customer is of the opinion that the agency presented him with ideas that he had already come up with before the presentation, he must notify the agency of this within 14 days of the day of the presentation by e-mail, citing evidence, which allow a chronological assignment to be announced.</li>
                                        <li>In the opposite case, the contracting parties assume that the agency has presented the potential customer with an idea that is new to him. If the idea is used by the customer, it can be assumed that the agency was meritorious.</li>
                                        <li>The potential customer can release himself from his obligations from this point by paying a reasonable compensation plus 20% sales tax. The exemption only occurs after the full payment of the compensation has been received by the agency.</li>

                                    <li>The scope of the services to be provided results from the service description in the agency contract or any order confirmation by the agency, as well as any briefing minutes ("offer documents"). Subsequent changes to the service content require written confirmation from the agency. Within the framework specified by the customer, the agency has freedom of design when fulfilling the order.</li>
                                    <li>All services provided by the agency (in particular all preliminary drafts, sketches, final artwork, proofs, blueprints, copies, color prints and electronic files) must be checked by the customer and approved by the customer within three working days of receipt by the customer. If they are not released in good time, they are deemed to have been approved by the customer.</li>
                                    <li>The customer will provide the agency with all information and documents that are necessary for the provision of the service in a timely and complete manner. He will inform you of all circumstances that are important for the execution of the order, even if they only become known during the execution of the order. The customer bears the expenses incurred due to the fact that work has to be repeated or delayed by the agency as a result of incorrect, incomplete or subsequently changed information.</li>
                                    <li>The customer is also obliged to check the documents (photos, logos, etc.) provided for the execution of the order for any copyrights, trademark rights, trademark rights or other rights of third parties (rights clearing) and guarantees that the documents are free of third-party rights and can therefore be used for the intended purpose. The agency is not liable in the case of slight negligence or after fulfilling its duty to warn - at least in the internal relationship with the customer - for a violation of such rights of third parties through the documents made available. If the agency is sued by a third party for such an infringement, the customer shall indemnify and hold the agency harmless; he has to compensate her for all disadvantages that arise from claims by third parties, in particular the costs of appropriate legal representation. The customer undertakes to support the agency in defending against any claims by third parties. The customer shall make all documents available to the agency without being asked.</li>

                                    <li>The commissioning of third parties in the context of an external service is carried out either in their own name or in the name of the customer. The agency will carefully select this third party and ensure that it has the necessary professional qualifications.</li>
                                    <li>Insofar as the agency commissions necessary or agreed external services, the respective contractors are not vicarious agents of the agency.</li>
                                    <li>The customer has to enter into obligations towards third parties that go beyond the contract period. This also applies expressly in the event of termination of the agency contract for good cause.</li>

                                    <li>If the agency's delivery/service is delayed for reasons for which it is not responsible, such as events of force majeure and other unforeseeable events that cannot be averted with reasonable means, the performance obligations are suspended for the duration and to the extent of the obstacle and the deadlines are extended accordingly. If such delays last more than two months, the customer and the agency are entitled to withdraw from the contract.</li>
                                    <li>If the agency is in default, the customer can only withdraw from the contract after he has given the agency a reasonable grace period of at least 14 days in writing and this has expired without result.

The agency is entitled to demand advance payments to cover its expenses. From an order volume with an (annual) budget of € …………….., or those that extend over a longer period of time, the agency is entitled to create interim invoices or advance invoices or to request payments on account.</li>
                                    <li>The fee is a net fee plus VAT at the statutory rate. In the absence of an agreement in individual cases, the agency is entitled to a fee at the usual market rate for the services rendered and the transfer of the copyright and trademark rights of use.</li>

In this case, the assertion of warranty and damage claims as well as the right to contest errors due to defects is excluded.</li>
                                    <li>In the event of a justified and timely notice of defects, the customer has the right to have the delivery/service improved or replaced by the agency. The agency will rectify the defects within a reasonable period of time, whereby the customer enables the agency to take all measures necessary for the investigation and rectification of defects. The agency is entitled to refuse to improve the service if this is impossible or involves a disproportionate amount of effort for the agency. In this case, the customer is entitled to the statutory conversion or reduction rights. In the case of improvement, it is up to the customer to transmit the defective (physical) item at his own expense.</li>
                                    <li>It is also the client's responsibility to check the service for its legal admissibility, in particular with regard to competition, trademark, copyright and administrative law. The agency is only obliged to carry out a rough check of legal admissibility. In the event of slight negligence or after fulfilling any duty to warn the customer, the agency is not liable for the legal admissibility of content if this was specified or approved by the customer.</li>
                                    <li>The warranty period is six months from delivery/service. The right of recourse against the agency according to § 933b paragraph 1 ABGB expires one year after delivery/service. The customer is not entitled to withhold payments due to complaints. The presumption of § 924 ABGB is excluded.</li>

In particular, the agency is not liable for legal costs, the customer's own legal fees or costs for the publication of judgments, as well as for any claims for damages or other claims by third parties; the customer must indemnify and hold harmless the agency in this respect.</li>
                                    <li>Claims for damages by the customer expire six months after knowledge of the damage; but in any case after three years from the infringing action of the agency. Claims for damages are limited to the amount of the net order value.</li>
